/**
 * This would be the module-info.java file if jsweet-transpiler was modularized.
 *
 * There currently are two obstacles:
 * 1. A test expects classes in the default package, which is not allowed in a modularized environment.
 * 2. Eclipse fails to launch tests due to a stack overflow error ...
